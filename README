HTML::WikiConverter::PhpWiki version 0.50
=========================================

HTML::WikiConverter::PhpWiki adds the PhpWiki dialect to
HTML::WikiConverter allowing the conversion of HTML to PhpWiki markup.

SYNOPSIS

Converting HTML to wiki markup is easy:

  use HTML::WikiConverter;
  my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'PhpWiki' );
  print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

Or from the command line:

  % html2wiki --dialect PhpWiki input.html > output.wiki

There's also a web interface if you're so inclined:

separate CPAN package.
